This project is a complete 3D simulation of the ASTU GEDA Gate built from scratch using **C++ and OpenGL (FreeGLUT)**.

It started as a simple 2D class project, and later I expanded it into a full 3D environment through weeks of learning, improvement, and experimentation.

## 🧠 Features

- Procedurally generated landscape (roads, pavements, parks)
- Dynamic scene elements (trees, benches, streetlights, vehicles)
- Architectural detail (arches, walls, logos with geometry and intersections)
- Interactive camera and navigation
- Layered rendering with realistic lighting and materials

## 📌 How to Compile & Run

1. Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
2. Install FreeGLUT library
3. Compile with:

```bash

g++ main.cpp -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -lglu32 -o ASTU_GATE
```
