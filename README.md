# Overview
```
This project is a full 3D simulation of the ASTU GEDA Gate, developed in C++ using OpenGL (FreeGLUT).
It started as a 2D class assignment, but I wanted to push myself further, improving my 3D graphics, geometry, and interactive programming skills.

Now, it’s a fully interactive 3D environment with procedurally generated landscapes, dynamic elements, and architectural accuracy.

## 🧠 Features
```
Procedural Landscape
Roads, pavements, parks, and greenery are generated programmatically.
Precise placement of trees, benches, streetlights, and buses.
Architectural Accuracy
Arches, walls, and logos modeled using mathematical geometry and intersections.
Detailed modeling for realistic proportions and scaling.
Interactive Camera
Move freely through the 3D scene using keyboard controls:
W / S → Forward / Backward
A / D → Left / Right
Q / E → Up / Down
Graphics & Rendering
Layered rendering with OpenGL lighting, normals, and materials.
Dynamic scene composition for realism.

2. Install FreeGLUT library
3. Compile with:


# Lessons Learned

3D Graphics: Learned to build a full 3D environment with accurate geometry and interactive controls.
Procedural Design: Learned how to generate landscapes, streets, and objects programmatically.
Problem Solving: Overcame challenges with OpenGL rendering order, normals, and lighting.
Self-Improvement: Started as a 2D class project, now upgraded to full 3D — bigger learning, bigger knowledge, and a lot of fun coding!

```bash

g++ main.cpp -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -lglu32 -o ASTU_GATE
